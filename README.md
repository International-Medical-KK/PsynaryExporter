The PsynaryExtractor is command line program to be run from the command line or terminal.

The program requires a few parameters from you to run.  These are:

1. The location (server) of the database.  This is most likely 'localhost' (which is your pc).  You might also try '127.0.0.1'.

2. The user name of the database.  If you created the database on your pc, you gave it a username.  This will be same.

3. Password - same as above (2).

4. Finally, the name of the database. Probably 'psynary'.  But if you created one locally, this will be whatever you used to name the local database.

So, for me, I run this like:

PsynaryExporter.exe localhost james MyPassword psynary

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you have more questions.
